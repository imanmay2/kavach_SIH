"""
Compliance sub-agents package.

Each module in this package independently calculates a score, generates
recommendations, and produces detailed analysis for ONE regulatory
framework. The orchestrator (governance_agent_v1.py) calls each agent's
`run(...)` function and merges the results — it no longer contains any
framework-specific scoring logic itself.
